#  Hi, I'm TemnyZlo

###  Full-Stack Dev |  Indie Game Aspirant |  BSc. Computer Science

I'm a software engineer who lives at the intersection of robust backend logic and immersive digital worlds. Whether I'm architecting a scalable API or wrestling with vertex normals in Blender, I’m always building something new.

###  What I'm Up To

* ** Deep Diving:** Mastering the latest `.NET Core` design patterns and optimizing `PHP` workflows.
* ** Gamedev Journey:** Currently building interactive experiences in `Unity`—where my code actually has physics.
* ** 3D Modeling:** Modeling assets in `Blender` so I don't have to rely on "Developer Art" (cubes and spheres).
* ** Collaboration:** Open to cool projects involving web apps, game mechanics, or anything that challenges my `C#` skills.
